            <p>Eleven centuries we to Indian skill owe!</p>

    <p>"OH NO, WE NEVER MENTION IT."&mdash;The KENDALS have got a
    Play by a young American Author with the very uncompromising
    name of DAM. He, or his Play, may be Dam good, or just the
    reverse: still, if he does turn out to be the "big, big D,"
    then all the Dam family, such as Amsterdam, Rotterdam,
    Schiedam, and so forth, will be real proud of him. Future Dams
    will revere him as their worthy ancestral sire, and American
    Dam may become naturalised among us (we have a lot of English
    ones quite a <i>spécialité</i> in that line, so the French
    say), and become Dam-nationalised. What fame if the piece is
    successful, and DAM is on every tongue! So will it be too, if
    unsuccessful. Englishmen will welcome the new American
    playright with the name unmentionable to ears polite, and will
    recognise in him, as <i>the</i> Dam <i>par excellence</i>,
    their brother, as one of the uncommon descendants of A-DAM. By
    the way, the appropriate night for its production would be
    Christmas Eve. Fancy the cries all over the House, calling for
    the successful Author!!</p>

    the stage, and the people come pouring in to see it. I
    suppose," says he, "they'll now call me 'The Wetter'un?" The
    ballet is very effective, not a drop too much, and "not a drop
    in the business" in front of the house, though there is, as is
    evident, on the stage. If Manager JOHN liked to quote
    SHAKSPEARE with a difference, in his advertisements, he might
    say, "With a hey, ho, the Wind and the Rain! For the Rain it
    raineth every night!" For some time to come this show will be
    the raining favourite at the Alhambra. By the way, the
    <i>Sheffield Telegraph</i>, describing the alterations and
    improvements in front at the Alhambra, wrote&mdash;"The ceiling
    has been bevelled with porous plasters so as to hide the
    girders." We know that hand:&mdash;it's Our "Mrs. RAMSBOTHAM,"
    and she "comes from Sheffield." However, "porous plasters"
    would be another attraction at the Alhambra, or anywhere, as
    they certainly ought to <i>draw</i>.</p>

    <h2>LADY GAY'S SELECTIONS.</h2>

    <p class="author"><i>Mount Street, Grosvenor Square</i>.</p>

    <p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,</p>

    <p>Unlucky Leicester was even more unlucky than usual&mdash;and
    when the big race was run last Wednesday, so thick was the
    rain, that the horses could only be seen for the last half
    mile! Of course this made all the difference to the horse I
    selected&mdash;<i>Windgall</i>&mdash;who finished
    second;&mdash;as he only gives his <i>best</i> performances
    <i>in public</i>, and as he doubtless <i>knew he couldn't be
    seen</i>, he thought it was only a private trial until he got
    close home, when his gallant effort was too late to be of any
    use!&mdash;at least, this is how <i>I</i> read the result of
    the race, and who can know more about a horse than the
    racing-prophet, I should like to know?</p>

    <p>I was told by Sir WALTER GREENINGTON, that the public
    "tumbled over each other" to back <i>Breach</i>, but I must say
    I didn't notice anything of the sort, and it was not the kind
    of day anyone would choose for a roll on the turf, the state of
    which was detrimental to any kind of <i>Breach</i>!&mdash;The
    believers in "coincidences"&mdash;(of which I need hardly say
    <i>I</i> am one&mdash;a coincidence being a truly feminine
    reason for backing a horse)&mdash;had no option but to back the
    winner, <i>Rusticus</i>; as he drew the same berth he occupied
    in last year's race, which he alsop&mdash;(I mean
    also)&mdash;won for Mr. HAMAR BASS!&mdash;<i>Stuart</i> was a
    great eleventh hour tip&mdash;(why <i>eleventh</i> hour I
    wonder?&mdash;more than any other&mdash;and who fixes the
    precise moment when the <i>eleventh</i> hour
    commences?)&mdash;but history tells us the STUARTS were mostly
    unreliable; and though I am told he ran a "great horse"&mdash;I
    thought him rather on the small side myself!</p>

    <p>I hear that Mr. LEONARD BOYNE has received a "licence to
    ride" from the Jockey Club, and that his ambition is to ride
    the winner of the "Grand National"&mdash;to which end he has
    started "schooling" a well-known chaser over the private
    training-ground in Drury Lane, belonging to Sir AUGUSTUS
    HARRIS&mdash;if he hopes to escape observation by training at
    night, I fear his design will be frustrated, as, on the
    evening, I went to witness this "new departure" in training, I
    found most of the London racing-touts present, with the
    inevitable field-glasses!</p>

    <p>Next week sees us once more at our beloved Newmarket First
    October&mdash;(this is a Jockey-Club joke, as the meeting
    <i>always</i> takes place in <i>September</i>! But what does a
    little paradox of this kind matter to such an <i>August</i>
    body!)&mdash;and I shall append my selection for the most
    important race of Wednesday, but I also wish to give a hint to
    the "Worldly Wise" not to miss the October Handicap, or the
    match, for which <i>Buccaneer</i> will be favourite at the
    "fall of the flag!"&mdash;(The flag may <i>fall</i>, but such a
    <i>Buccaneer</i> as this is will never "strike his flag" I feel
    sure!) Being absolutely overloaded with prophecy, I must also
    have a word to say on the Rutland Plate, which
    aristocratically-named race could only be won by the
    aristocratically-named <i>Buckingham</i>!&mdash;Yours
    devotedly, LADY GAY.</p>

    puzzled many people. Pen was accompanied by a sheet of paper
    that he called Treaty. Pen took Treaty everywhere. To Russia,
    to France, to Rome, and to Turkey. No one knew exactly what
    Treaty was like. Pen said he was satisfied with Treaty, and as
    Pen and Treaty were such constant companions, Pen's word on the
    subject was accepted as authentic.</p>

    <p>But one fine day there was a breeze, and Treaty was blown
    away by the wind.</p>

    <p>"Can I not assist?" asked Pen. "Things seem to have gone
    wrong."</p>

    <p>"No, thanks," replied Sword, grimly; "when it comes to close
    quarters, we find ink not quite so useful as gunpowder!"</p>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>Excursionists</i> (<i>impatiently</i>). Now then,
        what's this? What are we stopping here for?</p>

        <p><i>The Driver</i>. Ladies and Gentlemen, you will
        thoroughly understand that it is customary for the car to
        stop here, in order that the party may be photographed,
        thus providing an agreeable souvenir of the trip, and a
        useful means of identification at Scotland Yard. (<i>A</i>
        Photographer <i>appears in the road with a camera, and the
        party prepare themselves for perpetuation in a pleased
        flutter</i>.) P'raps, Sir&mdash;(<i>to a</i> Mild Man <i>on
        the box-seat</i>)&mdash;you'd like to be taken 'andling the
        ribbons? Most of our Gentlemen do.</p>
    </div>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>The</i> Mild Man <i>accepts the reins, and
        endeavours to assume a knowing and horsey
        expression.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>A Timid Lady</i> (<i>behind</i>). I <i>do</i> hope no
        Gentleman will take the reins, unless he is thoroughly
        accustomed to driving four-in-hand. Suppose they took it
        into their heads to run away suddenly!</p>

        <p><i>Driver</i> (<i>solemnly</i>). Don't you alarm
        yourself about that, Ma'am, in the very slightest degree.
        These 'osses take that pride in themselves, they'd stop
        here all day rather than spoil their own likenesses!</p>
    </div>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>The</i> M.M. <i>intimates that he is no novice in
        the art of driving, which is fairly true as regards a

        allayed.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>Photographer</i>. Now, steady all, please, those at
        the further ends of the seats stand up so as to come into
        the picture, a little more to the right, please, the
        gentleman in the straw 'at, turn your 'ead a trifle more
        towards the camera, the lady in the pink
        shirt,&mdash;that's better. Better take off your

        <p><i>The Driver</i>. On your left, Ladies and Gentlemen,
        you have the Prison&mdash;the cheapest Hotel in the Island
        for parties who intend making a protracted stay here. On
        our right we are now passing "Paradise." You will observe
        that someone has 'ung his 'at and coat up at the entrance,
        not being certain of getting in. Notice the tree in
        front&mdash;the finest specimen on the island of the good
        old Guernsey hoak.</p>

        <p><i>The Timid Lady.</i> I wish he wouldn't talk so much,
        and look more where he is going&mdash;we're <i>much</i> too
        near the hedge!</p>

        <p><i>Driver</i> (<i>standing up, and turning his back on
        the horses, as they trot on</i>). Ladies and Gentlemen, you
        will all thoroughly understand that the roads in this
        Island are narrow. Consequently, you must look after the
        branches and briars yourselves. I've enough to do to look
        after my 'orses, I assure you, and it looks bad to see 'ats
        and bonnets decorating the 'edges after the car has passed.
        (<i>Some of the Excursionists look at one another
        uneasily.</i>) The glass-'ouses you see in such quantities,
        are employed in the production of early grapes and tomators
        for the London Market. This Island alone exports
        annually&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Here he is conscious of being furtively prodded in

    </blockquote>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>Driver</i> (<i>rising as before</i>). Those
        buildings, Ladies and Gentlemen, are Chemical works for
        extracting iodine from seaweed. The seaweed, after being
        dried, is then boiled, and from the ash&mdash;</p>
    </div>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Here the</i> Mild Man, <i>who has been listening
        with much interest, is startled by receiving a folded piece

    </blockquote>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>The M.M.</i> (<i>to himself, as he reads the
        message</i>). "Keep the Driver quiet. He is drunk." Good
        Gracious! I never noticed&mdash;and yet&mdash;dear me, I
        hope they don't expect <i>me</i> to interfere!</p>

        <p><i>The Timid Lady</i> (<i>to the</i> Driver). For
        goodness sake never mind about iodine now&mdash;sit down
        and attend to your driving, like a good man!</p>

        <p><i>Driver</i>. You will thoroughly understand, my horses
        require <i>no</i> attention. (<i>Sleepily.</i>) No
        attention whatever. I assure you I am perfectly competent
        to drive this car and give you information going along at
        the same time. (<i>The car takes another corner rather
        abruptly.</i>) Simply matter of habit. (<i>Gravely.</i>)
        Matter'f habit!</p>

        <p><i>A Serious Exc.</i> (<i>in an undertone.</i>) A very
        <i>bad</i> habit, I'm afraid. It's really time somebody
        else took the reins from him!</p>

        <p><i>The M.M.</i> (<i>overhearing</i>). I'm afraid they
        mean me&mdash;I wish now I'd never touched the reins at
        all!</p>

        <p><i>Driver</i>. The Church we are now coming to, is St.
        Martin's, built in the year eleven 'undred.</p>

        <p><i>A Female Exc.</i> (<i>critically</i>). It <i>has</i>
        got an old-fashioned look about it, certainly.</p>

        <p><i>A Male Exc.</i> There's nothing to see inside of
        these old churches. I went in one the other day, and I was
        looking up at the rafters, and I saw a sort o' picture
        there, and I said, "Ullo&mdash;they've been advertising
        Pears' Soap here, or something." But when I looked again,
        it was only an old fresco. I was so little interested I
        walked out without tipping the Verger!</p>

        <p><i>The Female Exc.</i> That Church we went to on Sunday
        evening is very old.</p>

        <p><i>Her Comp.</i> Is it? How do you know?</p>

        <p><i>The F.E.</i> Why, my dress was covered with bits of
        fluff out of the hassock!</p>

        <p><i>Driver.</i> The carved stone figure you see by the
        gate, is supposed to be a portrait of Julius Cæsar's
        Grandmother, and very like the old lady. (<i>The</i>
        Excursionists <i>nearest him smile in a sickly way, to
        avoid hurting his feelings, as the car moves on&mdash;to
        halt once more at Icart Point.</i>) It is customary to
        alight here and go round the point, and I can assure you,
        Ladies and Gentlemen, the scenery is well worth your
        inspection and will give you a little idea of what the
        Island <i>is</i>.</p>

        <p><i>Excursionists</i> (<i>taking advantage of the
        opportunity to discuss the situation</i>). I noticed it the
        minute I set eyes on him&mdash;he never ought to have been
        sent out like this ... He's been to a wedding this morning,
        so I heard, and it's upset him a little, that's all ...
        Upset <i>him</i>&mdash;we're lucky if he doesn't upset
        <i>us</i>. What a fidget you are! I shan't take <i>you</i>
        into Switzerland next year, if you're like this... If
        Switzerland's full of a lot of drunken men, I don't want to
        go... Well, what had we better <i>do</i> about it? Perhaps
        <i>this</i> gentleman would&mdash;Oh, no, I couldn't take
        the responsibility, really, not without knowing the way.
        Well, we can't <i>walk</i> back, that's certain&mdash;we
        must trust to luck, that's all! Pretty bit of the coast you
        get here ... Oh, don't talk about the scenery <i>now</i>,
        when, for all we know!&mdash;&amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
    </div>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>The car starts again, and presently arrives at a
        winding and precipitous road leading down to Petit Bot Bay,
        where the</i> Driver <i>again rises with his back to the

        as they sit paralysed with horror.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>Driver</i>. Ladies and Gentlemen, at this point I
        shall explain the scenery. (<i>The</i> Timid Lady
        <i>protests that she is content to leave the scenery
        unexplained.</i>) Pardon me, this is a portion of the
        scenery&mdash;(<i>Here his eyes close and reopen with an

        <span class="pagenum"><a name="page149"
           id="page149"></a>[pg 149]</span> scenery that can only
           be properly enjoyed coming out on one of these cars. If
           you go out with ordinary drivers, they take you along
           the main roads, and you come away fancying you've seen
           the Island. Now the advantage of coming along with
           <i>me</i>&mdash;(<i>His eyes close once
           more&mdash;the</i> Excursionists <i>implore him to
           attend to his team</i>.) You will thoroughly understand
           there is not the slightest cause to apprehend any
           danger. I've driven this car fifteen years without least
           accident&mdash;up to <i>present</i>. So you can devote
           your whole attention to the scenery, without needing to
           keep an eye upon the Driver. (<i>He points to the
           abyss</i>.) That is the <i>shortest</i> way
           down&mdash;on this occasion, however, I shall endeavour
           <i>not</i> to take it. (<i>He whips up his horses, and
           accomplishes the descent at a brisk pace</i>.) There,
           didn't I <i>tell</i> you there wouldn't be no accident?
           Very <i>well</i>, then. P'rhaps you'll believe me
           another time!</p>

        <p><i>Mild Man</i> (<i>alighting at Hotel for

    <h3>RUBY AND THE ROOK.</h3>

    <p>RUBY, although she was something of a tomboy, was a pretty
    and clever girl.</p>

    <p>But, like many pretty and clever little ladies, she was
    sometimes very naughty. When she was good, she was as good as
    gold, but when she was naughty, she was as naughty as
    pinchbeck.</p>

    <p>The other day, when her dear Mamma was away for the morning,
    it happened to be one of her pinchbeck times. Nothing would
    please her&mdash;she was cross with her governess at breakfast,
    she quarrelled with her bread-and-milk; and even when her
    favourite tame Rook, Cawcus, came hopping on her shoulder, she
    refused to give it anything to eat, but hit it on the beak with
    her spoon.</p>

    <p>Miss DUMBELL was very much grieved at the way in which her
    pupil lolled in her chair, gave sullen answers, and put flies
    in the milk-jug, and pinched the cat's tail. "Mind, RUBY," said
    Miss DUMBELL, "at eleven o'clock I shall expect you in the
    school-room with that page of French phrases quite perfect."
    RUBY's eyes flashed as she went out of the room; she pouted,
    she swung her skirts, and shook her shoulders, so that even
    Miss DUMBELL, the most patient and kindest of governesses,
    quite longed to slap her.</p>

    <p>RUBY went to the school-room; she immediately flung the
    French phrase-book from one end of the room to the other. She
    took some story-books, and a little basket full of apples,
    bath-buns and "three-corners," and ran down to a little
    plantation called the Wilderness, at the bottom of the garden.
    She selected one of the tallest elms, and as she could climb
    like a kitten, she was soon at the top of it, quite hidden from
    view among the leaves.</p>

    <p>"So much for old DUMMY and her French phrases!" said the
    naughty girl, as she settled herself in a comfortable position
    and brought out her story-book. The stable-clock had struck
    twelve, and she heard her name called in all directions, by
    JORGINS, the gardener, BRILLIT, the buttons, and long-suffering
    Miss DUMBELL. They could not find her anywhere, and her Most
    Serene Naughtiness sat screened by the leaves and shook with
    laughter.</p>

    <p>Presently "Cawcus," her pet Rook, came fluttering amid the
    leaves, and began to caw. RUBY offered him bits of Bath bun,
    and even a whole three-corner, in order to keep him quiet.</p>

    <p>But he remembered his treatment at breakfast, and refused
    all these bribes with scorn. He declined to be petted, he
    continued to hover over the tree, and circle around it, giving
    vent to the most discordant shrieks. Presently she heard the
    clear measured tones of her Mamma's voice saying, "RUBY, come
    down at once. I know you are up in the elm." Cawcus, whom she
    had maltreated, had betrayed her hiding-place.</p>

    <p>RUBY dared not disobey. Quite subdued, and with garments
    grievously greened, she descended. Mamma took her little
    daughter indoors, and improved the occasion. RUBY eventually
    appeared, with tears in her eyes, and subsequently apologised
    to her governess, recited the page of French phrases without a
    mistake, and promised to be a good girl. Though she sometimes
    forgot herself, and was rude to Miss DUMBELL afterwards, she
    never failed to treat Cawcus the Rook with most profound
    consideration and reverence.</p>

    <p>ANNOUNCEMENT.&mdash;The Earl of LATHOM (who, being quite six
    feet or more, cannot be described as Small and Earl-y) is to
    lay the foundation-stone of "The Cross Deaf and Dumb School for
    N. and E. Lancashire." Now the Deaf and Dumb are, as a rule,
    exceptionally cheerful and good-tempered. It is quite right,
    therefore, that exceptions to this rule should be treated in a
    separate establishment, and that the "Cross Deaf and Dumb" ones
    should have a house to themselves. <i>Prosit!</i></p>

    <h3>THE PICK OF THE BASKETS.</h3>

    <p>The <i>Daily Graphic</i> published a specific against
    cholera, alleged to have been invented by Doctor PICK, a
    German. Evidently "Our pick'd man of countries." As it is
    something to drink, and not to eat, the inventor is under no
    necessity to be known henceforth as Dr. PICK-AND-CHEWS. His
    remedy is to treat the <i>bacilli</i> to Rhine Wine. The result
    of experiments has been "so much the worse for the
    <i>bacilli</i>." Substitute for the first vowel in "grapes" the
    third of the vowels, and it is of that the poor bacillus
    suffers, and dies. As the poet GROSSMITH sings of the German
    Rhine,&mdash;</p>

    <p>I do not allude to the white wooden Venetian work that
    shades the Grand Hôtel windows. It is of the clique who insist
    on shutting the windows that I write. Briefly speaking, the
    inmates of the Grand Hôtel may be divided into two
    classes&mdash;the window-openers and the window-shutters. The
    former are all British. The same Britons who at the Club scowl
    at a suspicion of draught, and luxuriate in an asphyxiating
    atmosphere, band against "the foreigners" in this respect. We
    have a national reputation to keep up. We are the nation of
    soap, of fresh air, of condescending discontent; and when we
    are on the Continent every one else, including the native, is
    "a foreigner;" we carry our nationality about with us like a
    camp-stool; we squat on it; we are jealous of it; it is a case
    of "<i>Regardez, mais ne touchez pas!</i>"</p>

        <h4>COMMERCIAL INSTINCT.</h4>
    </div>

    <p><i>Original Genius</i> (<i>soliloquising</i>). "Lor, it 'id
    bin a crool Shame to miss an Opportunity like this 'ere. The
    gov'nor oughter lemme 'ave Ten Bob on that job!"]</p>

    <p>This patriotic obtrusiveness culminates in the Battle of the
    Windows. It is an oppressive evening. The <i>Table
    d'Hôte</i>-room is seething like a caldron; a few chosen
    conspirators and myself open the campaign early; we "tip" ADOLF
    "the wink." That diplomatist orders the great window to be
    half-opened. If things go smoothly, he will gradually open out
    other sources of ventilation. The Noah's Ark procession files
    in&mdash;all shapes and all languages, like the repast itself;
    DONNERWITZ, TARTARIN, SHIRTSOFF, SCAMPELINI; there is nothing
    in common between them&mdash;save the paper collar; they would
    hail international declarations of war to-morrow; but the sight
    of us, and that speck of air leagues them. "<i>Mein Gott, Die
    Engländer!</i>" coughs DONNERWITZ; "<i>Ce sont de fanatiques
    enrhumés!</i>" hisses TARTARIN; SHIRTSOFF sneezes the sneeze of
    All the Russias; "<i>Corpo di Bacco!</i>" cries SCAMPALINI;
    still nothing is done; the "<i>Potage à la reine</i>,"&mdash;so
    called from the predominance of rain-water&mdash;ebbs away in
    the commingled smacks and gulps of the infuriated Powers;
    "<i>Saumon du Rhin, sauce Tartare</i>" is being apportioned to
    the knives of all nations; it is perhaps the sight of his
    knife, from which soup only is sacred, that nerves the fuming
    DONNERWITZ to lead the attack. "Hst!" he shouts to the
    studiously unheeding ADOLF; "'nother bottil Pellell&mdash;ver'
    well sare!" chirrups ADOLF reassuringly to <i>me</i>;
    DONNERWITZ raises his knife; I fear for the consequences; he
    brings it down with a clang on the hardened tumbler of the
    Grand Hôtel; the timid <i>pensionnaire</i> of numberless
    summers starts and grows pale; SHIRTSOFF looks with peremptory
    encouragement towards the Teuton; "<i>Ach, gräsglich!</i>"
    rattles out DONNERWITZ, and strikes again; the cobra-like
    gutturality of that "<i>Ach</i>" is heart-rending; still no
    ADOLF; at a gold-fraught glance from my companions, he has
    ordered another detachment to the front; a fresh current of air
    invades the room. DONNERWITZ's knife is now brandishing peas;
    his offended napkin chokes him; with the yell and spring of a
    corpulent hyena, he rises and rushes to the windows. The timid
    <i>pensionnaire</i> and her shrinking sisterhood follow him,
    under the misconception that he is summoning them to admire the
    sunset; the sunset is their evening excitement, and DONNERWITZ
    can be sentimental in his calmer moments; but no "<i>Wie
    wunder, wunderschön!</i>" escapes him; a Saxon word, that even
    they can understand, is on his lips; the ring on his forefinger
    gleams luridly; bang, bang, bang; he opens fire; down go the
    windows, and DONNERWITZ resumes his seat of war, his napkin
    waving like a standard before him. It is now my turn; I don't
    like it; but my co-conspirators expect me to maintain the
    honour of our country: ADOLF cannot be trusted further; I
    advance furtively; the eyes of Europe are upon me; one by one I
    open them again and subside; a terrible silence supervenes.
    What next?&mdash;that is the question!</p>

    <p>But DONNERWITZ is not only a MOLTKE, he is also a BISMARCK;
    flushed and moist with exertion, he has foreseen this move; it
    is the hour of that inevitable "<i>Bavaroise</i>"; the fork has
    succeeded to the knife: his mouth is at last free to
    confabulate with his neighbour&mdash;the Lady from Chicago.</p>

    <p>"Wal, I call that slap-up rude," I hear her remark. "In
    Amur'ca we should just hev' him removed; but Englishmen are
    built that way; they fancy, I s'pose, they discovered
    CO-LUMBUS;" and then DONNERWITZ leans over the table and,
    grasping the united weapons of fork, knife, and spoon,
    addresses me with effervescent deliberation.
    "Pardon,&mdash;Mister,&mdash;but&mdash;dis&mdash;leddy,&mdash;haf&mdash;gatarrh;
    in a Sherman shentleman's
    house&mdash;most&mdash;keep&mdash;first&mdash;de&mdash;leddy
    zimmer; so!" I don't fully understand, but I feel that my
    chivalry is impugned. My confederates, too, round upon me; "Of
    course," they whisper, "had no idea the lady was an invalid."
    The brutes! I stutter an apology, and "climb down;" the windows
    are again hermetically sealed; and, as I slink away. I hear
    "<i>Viva</i>!" "<i>Hoch</i>!" and clinking glasses. Then ADOLF
    hurries up surreptitiously, and whispers, "Tell you vat, Sare:
    to-morrer you shoost dine on de terass; dere, plenty breeze,
    hein?" "Plenty breeze!"&mdash;and you pay three francs extra,
    and catch a cold.</p>

    you would do if you were visited by bores of the following
    kinds:&mdash;(1), a friend; (2), an enemy; (3), a
    proprietor.</p>

    <p>2. Show how a political article may be written, saying as
    little as possible in the greatest amount of space? Give
    specimens of "writing round a subject" without offending
    susceptibilities.</p>

    <p>3. What are the duties of a Dramatic Critic? Show, by a
    specimen article, how a critique of a bad play, indifferently
    performed, can yet be made to give satisfaction to the Author,
    the Manager, the Company, and the Public?</p>

    <p>4. What are the duties of a Special Correspondent at a Seat
    of War? Give a short descriptive article of a battle written in
    such a manner that the readers of your paper may learn
    everything without your getting shot as a spy, or drummed out
    of camp as an informer.</p>

    <p>5. What are the duties of a Reviewer? Describe the process
    of log-rolling, and give specimen of notices of
    books:&mdash;(1), when the Author is your friend, but you
    object to the Publisher; (2), when you hate the writer, but
    must not offend the gentleman whose name appears as the
    distributor, and (3), when you know nothing of the volume and
    its producer, but suspect that the Author reviews for another
    periodical, and that you may possibly get an order from his
    literary introducer.</p>

    <p>6. What are the duties of a Musical Critic? Show how it is
    feasible to write a most scientific notice without being able
    to distinguish the National Anthem, MASCAGNI's
    "<i>Intermezzo</i>," or "<i>The Wedding March</i>," from
    "<i>The Slue Bells of Scotland</i>."</p>

    <p>7. Distinguish the difference between "Our Own Commissioner"
    and "Our Own Correspondent," and "Our Special Reporter" and "An
    Occasional Contributor." Give the rates of remuneration (if
    any) attaching to each office.</p>

    <p>8. What is "City Intelligence?" Is it affected by the rise
    and fall of the advertisement columns? State the difference
    between "News Specially Communicated" and a puff paragraph.</p>

    <p>9. Give the statistics (if you are able) of the number of
    aspirants to Journalism who have risen and fallen. Show that a
    small certainty in the City is better than an occasional
    ten-pound note earned in Fleet Street.</p>

    <p>10. Write an essay upon the subject that Journalism is
    better as a stick than a crutch, and show that it is useless to
    take up your pen if you have not already provided (from other
    sources) for the payment of your butcher's book.</p>

    </div>

    <p>"My good friend," said HENRI, "your daughter is charming.
    She has been well brought up, and has the finest sentiments;
    but it is necessary that she should run away to Paris, and
    dodge the parson. Otherwise, how could she be called <i>The
    Prodigal Daughter</i>?"</p>

    <p>Sir JOHN saw the force of this reasoning, and consented.</p>

    <p>"And stay," said AUGUSTE, "we must really have a good set,
    and you must go a fox-hunting. You must have armour, and a
    breakfast, and all of you must wear hunting-coats. And look
    here, we can't do without flowers, and coats-of-arms, and open
    windows."</p>

    <p>"But," objected Sir JOHN, "if I am going a fox-hunting,
    surely it should be in the winter or spring. And how about the
    flowers?"</p>

    <p>"You have got them from Nice," replied AUGUSTE.</p>

    <p>So it was thus arranged. Sir JOHN's daughter, who was called
    ROSE MILLWARD WOODMERE, eloped and broke her father's
    heart.</p>

    <p>"But," exclaimed her bereaved parent, preparing to mount a
    horse that was waiting for him on the lawn amongst the
    flower-beds, "although my heart is breaking, I will show the
    world I am a true English gentleman by starting off to head the
    chace!"</p>

    <p>And he said this out of consideration for AUGUSTE and HENRI,
    because he knew they wanted what is technically known as a
    Curtain. And by this means he gave them one. And a good one
    too.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER II.&mdash;<i>A little Trip to Paris.</i></h4>

    <p>And then Sir JOHN and all his considerate family and
    acquaintances went to Paris to stay at the Grand Hôtel, which
    seemed to have been surrendered to them (at convenient times)
    for their special use. Sir JOHN was accompanied by a most
    useful villain, who showed the depth of his depravity by
    wearing a moustache of the deepest dye. So that this depth
    might be better known, he called himself DEEPWATER.</p>

    <p>"Sir JOHN," said this villain, "your daughter has come to
    Paris with Captain HARRY VERNON, and you should trounce
    him."</p>

    <p>"I will," replied Sir JOHN, heartily; "but surely I have
    seen my daughter, and my niece, and Captain HARRY BOYNE VERNON,
    and the Hon. JULIAN KNIGHT BELFORD, and Lord HARRY NICHOLLS
    BANBERRY (a comic Peer), and his wife (a converted Quakeress),
    and DUDLEY J.L. SHINE ROPER, a wicked but amusing Hebrew,
    hanging about. Cannot we meet for two minutes, and set
    everything to-rights?"</p>

    <p>"My dear Sir JOHN," returned MAURICE FERNANDEZ DEEPWATER,
    "pray consider yourself mistaken. As you say, if we all met
    together for two minutes in a room, the whole thing would be
    settled. But then I am distinctly under the impression that
    AUGUSTE LE GRAND and HENRI LE PETTITT would be confoundedly
    annoyed."</p>

    <p>"Oh," exclaimed Sir JOHN, "if you think <i>they</i> would be
    annoyed, do not say another word about it!"</p>

    <p>So the various characters gave one another a clear berth,
    and missed each other at the nick of time.</p>

    <p>But after awhile ROSE was left alone with the Hon. JULIAN
    BELFORD.</p>

    <p>"It is not very clear to me why we haven't married," said
    he.</p>

    <p>"Nor to me either!" she replied. "We dawdled a bit, and I
    daresay put it off because what one knows can be done at any
    moment is often not done at all."</p>

    <p>"Well, hadn't we better go to the British Embassy?"</p>

    <p>"Why, yes." she replied, with some hesitation; "but I really
    think you had better say you will marry my cousin. I fancy it
    would please AUGUSTE and HENRI."</p>

    <p>"Anything to oblige them," returned the Hon. JULIAN._</p>

    <p>"That being settled, please leave me, as I have to fall in a
    dead faint&mdash;must get an effective Curtain, you know!"</p>

    <p>The HON. JULIAN KNIGHT BELFORD nodded his head, and then
    ROSE MILLWARD WOODMERE fainted&mdash;with the desired
    result.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER III.&mdash;<i>Cackle</i> v. <i>'Osses. The
    Favourite wins.</i></h4>

    <p>And now Sir JOHN and his considerate circle had come to
    England, and were close to Liverpool.</p>

    <p>"My dear people," said HENRI, "never mind your love-making,
    never mind your plot, leave it to AUGUSTE, and he will pull you
    through."</p>

    <p>And HENRI was quite right. AUGUSTE went to work with a will,
    and did pull them through. He took them to the Grand National
    Steeple Chace, and showed them and all the world a sight the
    like of which they had never seen before. There were real
    horses, real touts, and a real winner. Oh, how it went! It was
    magnificent! And, before this great race, AUGUSTE (helped by
    HENRI this time) showed a training-stable, and how a favourite
    can be nobbled. It didn't in the least matter why it was done,
    or where it was done. It was a lovely sight to see somebody or
    other giving the wrong horse beans. And the horse liked them,
    and eat them with a zest, and felt none the worse for them. On
    the contrary, the beans seemed to give the creature sufficient
    vigour to carry on the running until Christmas at Drury Lane,
    with a trot to Covent Garden to follow, and then back again,
    perhaps to the old quarters, up to Easter.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:50%;">
        <a href="images/156-2.png"><img width="100%"

             </a>Oss-tentation; or, "Giving him Beans."
    </div>

    <p>"Ah, that will make all things right!" cried AUGUSTE.
    "<i>Voluptuary</i> will carry the whole of us&mdash;Authors,
    Managers, and Actors&mdash;to victory!" And he was
    right&mdash;<i>Voluptuary</i> did carry them to success&mdash;a
    gigantic one.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER IV.&mdash;<i>The Means justify the End.</i></h4>

    <p>And Sir JOHN and his considerate circle acted up to their
    principles to the very end.</p>

    <p>"ROSE, come to my arms!" said he, to his child; "you have
    been prodigal enough, it is now time for your reformation and
    conciliation."</p>

    <p>"Then may we marry?" asked the Hon. JULIAN.</p>

    <p>"Certainly!" was the reply.</p>

    <p>And the other couples were also satisfactorily accounted
    for.</p>

    <p>"Are you contented?" asked Sir JOHN, of AUGUSTE and
    HENRI.</p>

    <p>"How does it end?" was the answer, taking the shape of a
    question.</p>

    <p>"Happily for all. Not only for us, but for you and the
    Public generally."</p>

    <p>And AUGUSTE, HENRI, <i>Box</i> and <i>Cox</i>, and in fact
    everybody who was anybody, were satisfied. As indeed they
    should be.</p>

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
